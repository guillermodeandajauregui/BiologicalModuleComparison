##Step A: topological comparisons
#1 same number of nodes/edges? k
#2 same topological distributions (ie degree) k
#3 same number of connected components? k

##Step B: identity comparison
#4 same node/edge identities? k

##Step C: modular comparison

#### if same nodes
#use a measure such as nmi
#### else 
#make similarity matrix 
#6 same number of modules?

#7 same module size distribution? 

#8 same modular partition? 
  #only answerable if 1 and 5 are true 

#8b similar modules? 
  #Jaccard of nodes edges such that there is a Module in network X that is similar to module in network Y? 

##Step D: functional comparison
